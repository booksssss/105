Import os & cv2 in CreateVideo.py file.
Set a path for the Images folder.

Created a list variable named Images = [ ]
Using for loop to check each file in the folder using os.listdir(path)
For each file name, use os.splitext(file) to separate the name and extension from a file name.

Create an if condition to check if the extension of the file matches with the image extension.
Create a variable file_name by concatenating the path “/” and file name(Includes both name and extension).



Use print(file_name) to make sure filenames are formed correctly.
Add each file in the images list using .append()
Create a variable count to store len(images)
Create a variable named frame to read the first image from the images list. frame = cv2.imread(images[0])
Use frame.shape to capture width, height & Channels
Create a tuple variable size using width, height.


Use print(size) to check the result.
Create a variable out.
Assign with cv2,VideoWriter()
video name = Project.avi
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'DIVX')
fps = 0.8
Size = size


Create a for loop to add images to a videowriter.
for i in range(0, count-1)
Use cv2.imread() to reach each image
Add the image in Video using out.write()

Print a message to know the video is complete as print(“Done”)
